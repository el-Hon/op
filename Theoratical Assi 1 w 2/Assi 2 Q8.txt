If a method in a subclass has the same signature as a method in its superclass with the same return type, then the method is overridden, not overloaded. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameter list, and same return type as a method in its superclass, it overrides the method in the superclass.
This means that the method in the subclass will be called instead of the method in the superclass when the method is called on an instance of the subclass.
Overloading, on the other hand, occurs when a class has two or more methods with the same name but different parameters or different return types.
